# state the problem, work on possible solutions
# begin game with 2 players, establish o and x for player 1 and player 2
# each player takes a turn until game ends
# players input like this: R1C1 (row 1 column 1)
# check for victory in a loop

# what is victory?
# 3 x's or 3 o's in a row

# player 1 is circle, select a tile:
# R1C1

# display a board in the console like so??? doesn't look right
#   O |  | 
#   --------
#     |  |
#   --------
#     |  |

# scan for winners...
# logic: if r1c1 is circle, check r1c2, if r1c2 is a circle, check r1c3, if r1c3 is a circle, winner!
# but... no winner yet

# player 2 is circle, select a tile:
# r3c2
